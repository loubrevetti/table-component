# voya-table
table component for deep architecture, this table offers advanced features such as **data model importing, sorting, theming, , adaptive and cell templating**. Tables features are all generated by accessing the following properties listed below. also listen below shows you how to establish properties at a global level vs. column instance level.

###Implementation of table component
1. download repository into local machine
2. run ```npm install```
3. run ```jspm install```
4. with in your application you would write the following tags
  ```
   <voya-table api-url="" api-params={"method":"GET"}>
      <voya-column>address</voya-column>
      <voya-column>city</voya-column>
      <voya-column>state</voya-column>
      <voya-column name="zipcode">zip</voya-column>
    </voya-table>
    ```

  * data model assumption ```{'address':'11 main st', 'city':'wolcott', 'state':'CT', 'zipcode':'06489}```
  
    * *please note* **voya-table** *instaniates the table component object, in order to display data from model obtained by table component you must implement* **voya-column** *for each* **key value** *pair you wish to display. The logic of voya-column will use the column label as the* **key** *to search for in the* **model**. *If the key does not match the column label then you would simply need to add a* **name** *attribute to the* **voya-column** *instance.*
    
#Features
### data model importing
* **api-url:** property could be either a relative or absolute path to the service that would return a model or a static json file that is loaded with in the application, *note: if it is a static file then please set in api-params the property* **method:GET**
  * ex: ```relative-path: "/src/stub/staticFile.json", absolute-path: "http://www.voya.com/services/tableservice"``` 

* **api-params:** property which allows developer to implement a reuqest body for service call with in table component
  * ex: ```{'method':"POST", 'payload':{'key1':'value1','key2':'value2','key3':'value3'}}```

* **name:** property which allows developer search for key in data model if column label doe snot match key.
  * ex: ```<voya-column name="zipcode">zip</voya-column>```


### sorting *global and column-instance property*
* **sort:** setting sort to true on column instance will allow that instance to have the capability to sort the data model by ascending then descending and finally back to original data, If set on  table then all columns become sortable. **please remember that column instance properites will always override globale properties**
  * ``` column instance: <voya-column sort="true/false"></voya-column>```
  * ``` global instance: <voya-table sort="true/false"></voya-table>```


### theming *global and column-instance property*
* **theme:** setting theme to true on column instance will allow that instance to have the capability to theme that instance in 3 different themes, If set on  table then all columns become that theme. **please remember that column instance properites will always override globale properties**
  * ``` column instance: <voya-column theme="white/orange/red"></voya-column>```
  * ``` global instance: <voya-table theme=""white/orange/red"></voya-table>```
